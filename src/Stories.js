        <h2>The real mother</h2>
     <p>   Two women were fighting over a child. “He is my child, leave him alone,” cried the lady in the red sari. The poor child was too young to speak.

“No, he is mine,” cried the woman in the green sari.

Soon a crowd gathered.

The village elders took the quarreling women to a wise man. The village wise man asked the lady in the red sari, “What do you have to say?”

“He is my child, Sir. I was bathing in the river and had left my son on the bank. This woman lifted my child and ran away. I hurriedly dressed and ran after her,” said the woman.

The wise man asked the other woman to explain.

“She is a liar, Sir. I was the one bathing in the river. He is my only child. She came there, picked him up and ran. Luckily I could catch her,” said the other woman.

Villagers who were watching this drama did not know whom to believe.

The wise man got up. Using a twig, he drew a line on the ground. He asked the two women to stand on either side of the line, and placed the child in the middle. As instructed by the wise man, one woman held the child’s left hand and the other, his right hand.

“Now listen to me carefully,” said the wise man, “Both of you need to pull the child to your side. The child belongs to whoever drags him over to her side.”

The woman in red sari pulled the child hard with all her might. As the child cried in pain, the other woman, let him go.

“He is mine,” the woman in the red sari shouted in triumph, even as the other woman broke down in tears.

“Wait,” said the wise man turning to the villagers, “Who do you think loves the child more? She who pulled the child to her side or the one who let the child go?”

The villagers answered, “She who let go loves the child more.”

The wise man took the child away from the woman in the red sari. “Only a mother can have a tender heart for her child,” he said.

He handed the child over to the real mother who hugged the child. The child lifter was given a strict warning and allowed to go.

<h2>Agasthya drinks the ocean
</h2>
     <p>   
     The Devas and Asuras were cousins who were always at war. The Devas ruled Devalok, the world above Earth. The Asuras lived in the world below Earth, called Paatal. The Asuras grew stronger after sunset. So, the Asuras always attacked their cousins at night.

As the sun rose, the Devas grew stronger. They would be ready to attack the Asuras. But the Asuras would disappear! The Devas would search for them in heaven, earth and, below. But the Asuras could not be found anywhere. 

At last the Devas saw the Asuras’ footprints leading to the ocean. Indra, lord of the Devas, shouted, “They are hiding here in the ocean!” 

Vayu, the Wind God, shook in excitement, “Let’s get them!” 

Agni, the Fire God hissed, “But can we fight them under water?”

Indra looked around. He saw Sage Agasthya sitting on the beach, eyes closed in meditation. Indra went up to him, bowed, and sought his help. Agasthya was a powerful sage, who liked the Devas. He agreed to help them. 

Muttering a prayer to the Sun, he dipped his hands in the ocean and scooped some water. Lo, the next moment, all the water of the ocean was drawn into his palms! And the sage drank it all in one gulp!

As the great sage belched with satisfaction, the Asuras stood exposed on the dry ocean bed. 

The Devas pounced on them. Badly beaten, the Asuras fled from battle. The Devas roared in triumph. 

Seeing his cousins running away, Indra thought they would not trouble the Devas again. He thanked Sage Agasthya. “Sage, our job is done. You can now return the water to the ocean bed.”

Agasthya frowned, “Lord Indra, I have drunk and digested all the waters with my powers. How can I now put it back?”

Indra felt bad. Without the ocean all beings on earth would suffer. 

“Only one river can fill this empty space,” said Agasthya looking up at the sky, “We must wait for Ganga to come down to earth.”

Thus began the long wait for Ganga.

<h2>The generosity of Rantideva
</h2>
     <p>   
     Rantideva was born in a rich family. Even as a child, he would share his riches with the needy. He got married and had sons. With no thought for the future, Rantideva and his wife continued to be generous. No one went away from their home empty-handed.Ultimately, Rantideva ran out of money. His family had to go without food for months.

One day, Rantideva managed to get some rice, ghee, wheat and sugar. The family thanked God for giving them food and sat down to eat. 

Just then a holy man knocked at their door. Rantideva received the guest by bowing to him and served food to him. The holy man went away satisfied. Half of the food was still left for Rantideva and his family. 

As they sat down to eat, a hungry farmer came looking for food. Rantideva offered him a seat, made him comfortable, and served him food. The farmer enjoyed his meal.

There was still some food left. Rantideva’s family decided to share whatever had remained. As they sat down to eat, a traveller appeared at the door. He was accompanied by four dogs. He begged for food for himself and his four dogs. 

Rantideva offered whatever was left to the guest. He was happy to see the hungry dogs cleaning up the vessels.

There was no food left by the time the man took his leave.

Rantideva smiled, “God is kind, we have some water left.” Just then he heard someone cry, ”Oh sirs, I’m dying of thirst. Will a kind soul give me some water?”

Rantideva ran out to the street and saw a poor man overcome with thirst. He offered the water to the thirsty man. The man gulped water down.

As Rantideva looked at him, the poor man revealed himself as Brahma, the Lord of Creation.

“Rantideva, the gods came down to earth to test you. We are pleased with your spirit of sacrifice. We will be happy to grant any boon you ask for.”

Rantideva bowed to Lord Brahma and said softly, “May I always share whatever I have with my fellow men.”

Lord Brahma blessed Rantideva and restored his wealth. Rantideva and his family never went hungry again and continued to help those in need.

<h2>Krishna in Sudama’s village
</h2>
     <p>   
     When Sudama went to Dwaraka, his childhood friend Sri Krishna and his wife Rukmini, received him with affection. They persuaded Sudama to stay with them for a few days. Then they took him back to his village in their chariot.

Meanwhile, in the village, word spread that Sri Krishna was coming to their village. Villagers began to gather in Sudama’s cottage.

“Sri Krishna and Rukmini are visiting our Sudama’s house. We must make it fit for their visit,” said an elder.

“Let’s build a new home for our Sudama,” cried out a villager and all agreed.

The villagers worked day and night to build a big and spacious house, and decorated it with festoons. They brought new clothes and ornaments for Sudama’s family. They drew Rangoli (Kolam) in front of Sudama’s house and decorated it with flowers.

Sudama’s wife thanked the villagers for their affection.

Villagers lined up on both sides of the streets hailing Sri Krishna as he drove by. Sri Krishna stopped the chariot, jumped down and mingled with the villagers. Girls came running to him with dandiya and Sri Krishna danced with them.

At last, the procession reached Sudama’s house. Sudama’s wife brought water for Sri Krishna and Rukmini to wash their feet. Sudama wiped their feet dry with the cloth his wife gave him. His children fell at Sri Krishna’s feet.

“Bhabhi,” said Sri Krishna, “I’m hungry. What do you have for me?”

Sudama’s wife smiled.

“Govinda, I offer you what you have given us,” she said.

Then she brought him a bowl full of butter!

Sri Krishna jumped with joy as Rukmini clapped. The villagers joined their hands in salutation as Sri Krishna put the butter into his mouth.

<h2>Krishna meets Sudama
</h2>
     <p>   
     He was a visitor to Dwaraka. Draped in an ordinary looking cloth round his waist, a piece of cloth across his shoulders, and a bag hanging from his left shoulder, the stranger walked barefoot. His hair was combed and tied. He walked leisurely, neither too fast nor too slow, looking straight ahead, unmindful of stares that followed him.

The stranger headed straight to the palace. The guard outside the palace became alert. Tall, well built and with a thick moustache stretching from ear to ear and a huge helmet with two horns, he was a fearsome figure. Behind his back, people of Dwaraka called him Rakshasa, a demon, with enormous power, captured in a battle by Krishna, the Yadava hero. No doubt, he was devoted to his new Master, but the citizens of Dwaraka kept their distance.

Rakshasa frowned seeing the stranger approaching the palace. He was used to princes and kings arriving to meet his Master. He was glad to escort dignitaries to the courtyard of the palace. Never had he seen such a poor man approaching the palace. Intending to stop the unwelcome guest he stepped forward.

Just then, Sri Krishna came out of the palace. Seeing the stranger, he broke into a broad smile and ran to him, calling out, “Sudama, my friend, what a surprise!” Rakshasa froze as he saw Sri Krishna hugging the visitor! The visitor with tears of joy, hugged Sri Krishna calling him ‘Govinda.’

Hearing that a guest had arrived, Sri Krishna’s wife Rukmini came to the door. She brought water for the guest to wash his feet. Sri Krishna wiped his feet with the silken cloth he was wearing and made him sit on the swing. The two friends started talking about old times, as Rukmini sat close by fanning them gently.

Sri Krishna and Sudama were classmates in Guru Sandipani’s forest school. Patting his friend on the back, Sri Krishna said, “So you are married! Bhabhi must have sent something for me. Let me see what’s in your bag.”

Sri Krishna took Sudama’s bag and dug into it. He took out a small packet wrapped in cloth. Sudama smiled as Sri Krishna eagerly opened the bundle, watched by Rukmini.

Sudama smiled thinking of his wife he loved. Of late, he was thinking of his childhood mate, Govinda. He mentioned this to his wife. She urged him to go to Dwaraka and meet his friend. “You have been taking about your friend so long. You’d better go and meet him. He too will be happy to see you,” said his wife.

As he was about to leave, she gave him a packet bundled in a piece of cloth and said, “when you call on those you love and respect, you must give them something. Here is something I’ve put for your dear friend,” she said. Sudama thanked her and put it into his bag as he left for Dwaraka. He had no idea what his wife had given for Sri Krishna.

Now he would know, as Sri Krishna opened the bundle. It was poha, made from pounded rice!

Even the poorest of the poor manage to get some poha to fill their stomach. It is a poor man’s friend. What Sri Krishna saw in that poha was tremendous love his friend and his wife had for him. That made it divine. He eagerly stuffed his mouth with handful of poha as though he had not eaten for months! Sudama laughed with delight as Rukmini watched with a smile. Sri Krishna dipped into the packet and put into his mouth one more handful of poha with relish. As he munched poha rolling his eyes, Rukmini snatched the bag from Sri Krishna. “Spare something for me,” she said as Sudama burst out laughing.

Rukmini served a lavish lunch. Krishna himself served sweets to his friend. After lunch, Sudama wanted to leave. Both Sri Krishna and Rukmini urged him to spend a couple of days with him. “I want you to take us to your home. We want to meet Bhabhi,” said Krishna as Rukmini nodded her head in agreement.

<h2>The three promises
</h2>
     <p>   
     A young man named Aditya was walking through a forest. He came across a well. Aditya was thirsty and wanted to drink some water. But he was shocked to see a tiger, a snake and a man trapped inside the well, which was dry. All three pleaded with Aditya to pull them up.

Aditya was scared. “What if the tiger eats me? What if the snake bites me?” he thought. But the tiger assured him that he wouldn’t harm Aditya if he rescued him. The snake hissed in agreement.

Aditya threw a long rope inside the well to help the three out. The tiger came out first. “Thank you for helping me friend. If you are ever in this forest again, come visit me at my home. I promise to repay you for your help,” the tiger said.

The snake was the next to come out. “You are a brave young man. I promise that I will be there whenever you need my help. All you need to do is take my name,” the snake said.

Finally, it was the turn of the human. “Thank you. Thank you, good sir. I work as a goldsmith in the capital city. I promise to be your friend forever. Please visit me if you ever come to the city.”

Happy to have made new friends, Aditya resumed his journey. A few years later, he was passing by the same forest. Aditya remembered the tiger’s promise. He made his way to the cave where the tiger lived.

The tiger greeted him warmly. He gave him fresh fruits from the forest and water to drink. When Aditya was about to leave, the tiger gave him gold ornaments covered with precious gems. “Here’s a small gift my friend. I hope you like it.”

Aditya was grateful for the gift, but he didn’t know what to do with the ornaments. Then he remembered his friend, the goldsmith. The goldsmith would be able to melt the ornaments and give Aditya gold coins.

The goldsmith greeted Aditya warmly. He offered him cool lemonade and asked him about the journey. Aditya told him about his visit to the tiger and its gifts. He asked the goldsmith to help him by melting the ornaments and giving him gold coins.

The goldsmith was shocked when he saw the ornaments. The goldsmith had made them with his own hands for the king’s younger brother. The same younger brother who had gone missing in the forest a few months ago. The king had announced a reward for anyone who could provide information about the prince.

But the goldsmith hid his shock. “If I tell the king that this young man has killed the prince, he will definitely give me the reward,” he thought.

The goldsmith asked Aditya to rest for some time and made his way to the palace. The goldsmith said that he had found the man who had killed the king’s younger brother.

The king dispatched soldiers to the goldsmith’s house to arrest Aditya. The king refused to hear Aditya’s side of the story and threw him in jail.
